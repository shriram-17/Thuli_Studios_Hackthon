   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shriram-17/Thuli_Studios_Hackthon.git
   cd Thuli_Studios_Hackthon
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```plaintext
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   qdrant_api=your_qdrant_api_key
   groq_token = your_groq_token
   ```

## üñ• Usage

1. Collect repository data:
   ```bash
   python github_collection.py
   ```

2. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## üìÅ File Structure and Detailed Descriptions

### `app.py`
The main application interface built with Streamlit. Key components include:

- `main()`: Controls the main workflow, including sidebar navigation and page rendering.
- `home_page()`: Allows users to enter a GitHub repository URL and fetches data.
- `commits_page()`: Displays commit data and visualizations with CSV export option.
- `pull_requests_page()`: Shows pull request data and visualizations with CSV export option.
- `nlp_module_page()`: Processes user queries about commit data using graph and text agents.
- `display_metrics()`: Renders key repository metrics in a card layout.
- `developer_page()`: Displays metrics and visualizations for developer activity.
- `classify(user_query: str)`: Determines if a user query requires a graph or text response.

### `github_collection.py`
Collects data from GitHub repositories, including commits, pull requests, and issues. Main functions:

- `extract_repo_info(url)`: Parses GitHub URLs to extract owner and repository name.
- `process_commit(commit)`, `process_pull_request(pr)`, `process_issue(issue)`: Process individual data points.
- `collect_repo_data(owner, repo_name)`: Collects comprehensive data from a specified repository.
- `calculate_metrics(commits_df, prs_df, issues_df)`: Computes various metrics from the collected data.

### `text_agent.py`
Processes text-based queries and extracts relevant information from collected data. Key functions:

- `load_data(file_path: str)`: Loads commit data from CSV and adds a message_length column.
- `extract_entities(text: str)`: Uses spaCy to extract named entities from commit messages.
- `categorize_commit(message: str)`: Categorizes commits into predefined types.
- `preprocess_commits(df: pd.DataFrame)`: Extracts entities and categorizes commits in bulk.
- `summarize_data(df: pd.DataFrame, top_n_authors: int, top_n_entities: int)`: Summarizes commit data by top authors and entities.
- `generate_response(user_query: str, grouped_commits: pd.DataFrame, top_entities: dict)`: Generates responses to user queries using the Groq API.

### `graph_agent.py`
Generates visualizations based on data and user queries using Plotly. Main functions:

- `load_data()`: Loads and preprocesses commit data from CSV.
- `extract_entities(text)`: Uses spaCy for Named Entity Recognition on commit messages.
- `preprocess_commits(df)`: Processes commit messages to extract key information and count entity occurrences.
- `query_groq(user_query: str, data: pd.DataFrame, entity_counts: Counter, graph_type: str, graph_syntax: str)`: Queries Groq API with user input and commit data to generate visualization code.
- `image_groq(user_query)`: Orchestrates the entire process of loading data, preprocessing, querying for graph types, and generating visualizations.

### `qdrant.py`
Manages graph types and their syntax for visualizations using Qdrant. Key functions:

- `load_environment()`: Loads environment variables from the .env file.
- `initialize_qdrant_client()`: Sets up the Qdrant client for database interactions.
- `initialize_sentence_transformer()`: Initializes the SentenceTransformer model for text embedding.
- `get_plotly_graph_syntax()`: Provides syntax templates for various Plotly graph types.
- `query_graph_type(client, model, collection_name, user_description)`: Queries Qdrant to find the best matching graph type based on user descriptions.

### `commits_visualizations.py`
Handles the creation of visualizations specific to commit data. Key functions include:

- `preprocess_dataframe(df)`: Preprocesses the commit DataFrame for visualization.
- `plot_commit_timeline(df)`: Creates a timeline visualization of commits over time.
- `plot_commit_frequency(df)`: Generates bar plots showing commit frequency by hour, day of week, and month.
- `plot_commit_message_wordcloud(df)`: Creates a word cloud visualization of commit messages.
- `plot_commit_heatmap(df)`: Generates a heatmap showing commit activity patterns.

### `pr_visualizations.py`
Manages visualizations related to pull request data. Main functions:

- `preprocess_dataframe(df)`: Preprocesses the pull request DataFrame for visualization.
- `plot_additions_deletions(df)`: Creates a bar plot comparing code additions and deletions in pull requests.
- `plot_review_cycle_time(df)`: Generates a scatter plot showing review cycle times for pull requests.
- `plot_pr_state_distribution(df)`: Creates a pie chart showing the distribution of pull request states.
- `plot_pr_bubble_chart(df)`: Produces a bubble chart representing pull request complexity and size.

## üß† NLP Module

The NLP module allows users to input natural language queries about commit data. It utilizes both graph and text agents to generate insightful responses and visualizations based on the query content.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Activity

Tracks and visualizes various aspects of developer contributions:
- Commit frequency per developer
- Lines of code added/removed
- Pull request involvement
- Issue resolution rates

## üìà Metrics

Displays key repository metrics in a responsive card layout, including:
- Total commits and pull requests
- Average PR review time
- Most active contributors
- Repository growth rate
- Code churn
